# Apex Gundle
Apex Gundle is a [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) inspired, Apex Legends themed guessing-game that centers around its arsenal of weapons and their various attributes. Much like Wordle, when you guess a gun, any wrong attributes will be red, partial matches will be yellow, and parts that match exactly will be green. The gun changes every day so feel free to challenge your friends to see who can guess it the fastest!

Note: The data on the guns is up to date with Season 22 attributes only. To be updated to the most recent season in the future
